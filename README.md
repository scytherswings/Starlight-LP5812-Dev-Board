# Starlight-LP5812-Dev-Board
This is a dev board for the Texas Instruments LP5812 series ICs which can autonomously drive LEDs without an MCU

The intent of the project is to make it simple to start experimenting with the LP58XX series of chips from TI which offer some
interesting options for offloading LED animations from your MCU.
